When it's time to replace your old equipment, choose a high efficiency model, and make sure it is properly sized and installed. </p>";
tips[0][1] = "<strong>Efficient Appliances:</strong><br>When you replace an appliance, look for products with an ENERGY STAR® label. ENERGY STAR-qualified products are available in more than 40 product categories, including lighting, home electronics, heating and cooling equipment and appliances. If your local utility supports appliance recycling, find out how you can participate.";
tips[0][2] = "<strong>Be Water Wise:</strong><br>Municipal water systems require a lot of energy to purify and distribute water. Don't let water run while shaving or brushing teeth. Repair leaky faucets and toilets promptly. These simple actions can help households save hundreds of gallons of water each month: saving water, especially hot water, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.";
tips[0][3] = "<strong>Be Smart with Power Management:</strong><br>Did you know that your battery charger uses energy while plugged into the wall even when you’re not using it to charge your phone, laptop, or PDA? Unplug your appliances when not in use. Adjust power management settings for your computer to conserve energy. Consider using a power strip that can be turned off when you're done using your computers, printers, wireless routers and other electronics. Turn off lights in unoccupied rooms.";
tips[0][4] = "<strong>Replace Low-Efficiency Lightbulbs:</strong><br>Replace incandescent bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL). Check the package to match the bulb type with your fixture to get the best performance and life from the CFL.";
tips[0][5] = "<strong>Use Renewable Energy:</strong><br>Solar energy can be used to heat homes, buildings, water, and to make electricity. Today, more than 200,000 houses in the United States take advantage of the sun's energy. Find out about renewable energy incentives in your state: http://www.dsireusa.org/ ";
tips[0][6] = "<strong>Buy Seasonal Produce:</strong><br>Organic food tastes better and it’s kinder to the earth. Thirty percent of the fossil fuel used on farms goes into the making of fertilizers. Get greener by buying items grown or produced within 100 miles and you’ll reduce the amount of diesel fuel needed to ship food. You can get fresher food and help small-scale agriculture by shopping at neighborhood farmers’ markets.";
tips[0][7] = "<strong>Think Before you drive…</strong><br>Save energy by carpooling, taking public transportation, riding a bike, or walking. Another way to reduce your carbon emissions is to combine errands when you do drive.";
tips[0][8] = "<strong>Reduce, Reuse & Recycle:</strong><br>Recycle cans, bottles, plastic bags, and newspapers. Support recycling by purchasing items that are reusable and/or recyclable. When you recycle, you send less trash to the landfill and you help save resources that would be used in manufacturing non-recycled products.";
tips[0][9] = "<strong>Spread The Word!</strong><br>Talk with your family and friends about climate change. Let them know the ways you’re changing your lifestyle to help prevent more climate changes.";

tips[1][0] = "<strong>Lighting:</strong><br>Install lights sensors so that lights in sporadically used spaces turn off automatically when not in use and replace low efficiency lighting with higher efficiency flourescents.";
tips[1][1] = "<strong>HVAC System:</strong><br>Schedule heating and cooling systems to go on during pre-determined hours; let the system run hotter or cooler in off-hours, depending on the season.  Use natural heating and ventilation if possible. Set the temperature a degree or two warmer in the summer and a degree or two cooler in the winter. Clean air filters regularly and have your system tuned annually by a licensed contractor. When it's time to replace your old equipment, choose a high efficiency system.";
tips[1][2] = "<strong>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:</strong><br>Reducing, reusing, and recycling at your building helps conserve energy, and reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, and disposal. Provide bins for recycling paper, bottles, cans, and cardboard. ";
tips[1][3] = "<strong>Cleaning Supplies:</strong><br>Switch to products that are non-toxic and buy in bulk to minimize packaging waste.";
tips[1][4] = "<strong>The Office Kitchen:</strong><br> Avoid using paper plates and plastic utensils by providing dishes and utensils.";
tips[1][5] = "<strong>Manage office equipment energy use better:</strong><br>Office equipment and electronics use energy even when idle or on stand-by. To save energy at work, activate the power management features on your computer and monitor, unplug laptop power cords when not in use and turn off equipment and lights at the end of the day. Consider using a power strip that can be turned off when you're done using your computers, printers, wireless routers and other electronics.";

tips[2][0] = "<strong>Deferred Maintenance is costly to you and the environment!</strong><br>Reduce pollution from your current vehicle by getting regular tune-ups and making sure your tires are properly inflated to achieve your vehicle’s optimal gas mileage. Maintaining your vehicle properly helps prevent the need for unexpected repairs, saving you money and stress!";
tips[2][1] = "<strong>Flights:</strong><br>for business travel, consider whether a phone or video conference will get the job done. While flying emits less carbon per mile traveled than driving, the distances traveled usually translate to greater emissions overall. When you do need to fly, longer flight segments emit less carbon per mile than shorter flights. The reason? Elevated carbon emissions during takeoff and landing are the same whether the you are traveling 250 miles or 2500 miles."
tips[2][2] = "<strong>On vacation:</strong><br>consider renting a bicycle to explore locally rather than renting a car";
tips[2][3] = "<strong>Cars & Renewable Fuels:</strong><br>Before buying a new or used vehicle, check out the EPA green buying guide: http://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/. Highly fuel efficient cars, hybrids, and vehicles that use cleaner alternative fuels help reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Reduce pollution from your current vehicle by getting regular tune-ups and making sure your tires are properly inflated to achieve your vehicle’s optimal gas mileage.";
